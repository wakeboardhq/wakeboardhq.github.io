#  Predictive tools for Higher Ed cultures where personal & career development are mission-critical

###1. What are we building?

This is the MVP of a platform that will deliver the data on the association of social ties with academic and labor/job outcomes.

What you will be building is the social graph of a freshman college class. This exercise is meant to build the shell of the graph, where the 475 students of a freshman class are tied by class associations. What we will be measuring includes:

 a) Degree centrality — the number of a node has in a social network
 b) Closeness centrality — the distance of a node to all other nodes in a social network
 c) Betweenness centrality —the number of shortest paths between any two nodes that go through a given node
 d) Eccentricity—the distance between a node and its farthest node in a socialnetwork


The Stack: the preferred application stack will assume a Django backend whose REST API will be used by React in the front end.

The project: The project is to display data
